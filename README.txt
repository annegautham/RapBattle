Hello! Welcome to my rap battle project. 

In python, you would need to install the pronouncing library through pip with

pip install pronouncing

Also, if you would like to play audio files, install playsound with

pip install playsound

and uncomment out the lines with Audio,py (I couldn't run them on WSL)! Audio files are not necessary to run, however!

In the linux terminal, install asciiview to view the rad images of _____ with

sudo apt install asciiview

To exit asciiview, enter 'q' into the terminal.

Also, make sure to have figlet installed.

Basically, the idea of this project is to have the user prompted with a phrase, and then they would have to complete 
another phrase by rhyming it to the first one. If you were able to, you succeeded, and a congratulatory message appears,
and if not, you get insulted. The score is returned at the end. Note that words that are the same are not considered to rhyme!

_____ is no slouch at rapping, so bring your a-game y'all.
